# Gradio Chatbot Tutorial

This simple Gradio demo shows how a chatbot can read user input and send back a friendly reply.

## Run the demo

Launch the app from the project root:

```bash
python gradio/chatbot.py
```

After the server starts, Gradio opens a browser window where you can experiment with the chatbot UI.
